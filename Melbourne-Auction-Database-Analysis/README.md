# Melbourne Property Auction Analysis

## SummaryüñäÔ∏è
### The dataset as it appears encapsulates the key details of the real estate transactions. It includes information such as suburbs, address, number of rooms, type of property, price, method of sale, etc. of the property sales in suburbs of Melbourne, Australia.

This is the dataset which I am going to work on. ![Data Snippet](https://github.com/Shruti-Nagar/pictures/blob/main/Melbourne%20Auction/Data.jpg)
